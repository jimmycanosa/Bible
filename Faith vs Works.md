This is the true Gospel of [[Jesus]] Christ.
The word gospel literally means “good news”.

The faith vs. works debate often comes up in convos re salvation. Many say that a person is saved based on some mixture of faith and works. Biblical Christianity teaches salvation by faith in [[Jesus]] Christ, separate from any works we may do.

Let’s clearly define faith and works. 

**What is faith?**
[[Hebrews#^667724|Hebrews 11:1]] - “Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.”

Faith assures us that our hope is reality, even though we cannot yet see it. If we have faith, we are certain that what we believe is real, true, and reliable. The biblical object of faith is the person and work of [[Jesus]] Christ.

**What are works?**
Works are a person’s deeds and/actions. Work is that which we perform for some kind of reward. We work for a living and expect to get paid for it. Even working on a voluntary basis has its own reward—praise from others, a feeling of good will, whatever.

In the context of salvation, “works” refers to good deeds we do.

In the faith vs. works debate, the two arguing sides maintain that either we are saved by faith (and faith alone), or we are saved by works (or, more commonly, works added to faith). Which side is correct? What is the biblical relationship between faith & works?

**Works** are required for salvation—but Scripture is clear that those works are Christ’s, not ours. [[Jesus]] fulfilled the law ([[Matthew#^4e62b8|Matthew 5:17]]). In fact, “the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith” ([[Galatians#^648195|Galatians 3:24]]).

[[Jesus]]’ death/sacrifice on the cross reconciled us to God ([[Romans#^ab1c97|Romans 5:8-10]]), and as He died, [[Jesus]] proclaimed that the work was finished ([[John#^7fd435|John 19:30]]).

We are now invited to enter into God’s “rest” by faith: “Anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works” ([[Hebrews#^7cab74|Hebrews 4:10]]).

Our work does nothing to earn or maintain salvation. It was the once-off-for-everyone sacrifice of Christ that justified sinners ([[Romans#^0da537|Romans 3:24]]). “know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, …because by the works of the law no one will be justified” ([[Galatians#^c70b8d|Galatians 2:16]]).

**We start by faith, and we continue in faith**: “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?” ([[Galatians#^5b7f3c|Galatians 3:2-3]]).

Salvation is by grace, which precludes work. Grace is, by def, unearned & the Bible makes it clear that God’s grace in salvation destroys the argument for human effort: “If by grace, then it can’t be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace” ([[Romans#^df62da|Romans 11:6]]).

“It is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast” ([[Ephesians#^28cd35|Ephesians 2:8-9]]). Read that again: “… so that no-one can boast”.

God’s requirement for salvation is faith in His Son. One of the grand themes of the Bible is that we are justified (declared righteous) by faith ([[Genesis#^77fdf1|Genesis 15:6]]). Faith is the only means of making sinful human beings able to stand before a Holy God.

There is really no amount of law-keeping or good works which can accomplish it ([[Titus#^04380d|Titus 3:5]]). If our works could save us, then Christ died for nothing ([[Galatians#^d4b496|Galatians 2:21]]). It is this … read that again, “then He died for nothing”.

**We do good works not to earn salvation; rather, we are saved first, compelling us to do good works**: Works are the product/result of faith. Those who have true faith in [[Jesus]] Christ will be “eager to do what is good” ([[Titus#^14c8f1|Titus 2:14]]). John the Baptist called for “fruit in keeping with repentance” ([[Matthew#^266d43|Matthew 3:8]]).

James emphasizes the nature of true saving faith as that which results in good works: “Faith without works is dead”.  and “As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead” ([[James#^49b5bf|James 2:17, 26]]).

Grace through faith saves, and that faith manifests in works. If someone claims to have faith yet exhibits no good works, his or her faith is “dead,” or non-existent.

Faith vs works thing is a non-debate, both are integral parts of a believer’s life. “Faith” causes salvation, while “works” are the evidence of it.
