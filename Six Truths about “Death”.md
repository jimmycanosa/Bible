### The Rich Man and Lazarus

[[Luke#^536e6d|Luke 16:19-31]]

1. Right after death is judgment.
	[[Hebrews#^273b59|Hebrews 9:27]] – Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.
2. The soul is still conscious. 
	Lazarus vs rich man
	Comforted vs agony
	Heaven vs Hell
3. There are only 2 destinies. 
	Heaven or Hell.
4. The soul cannot go back to Earth.
5. The dead is the one petitioning for the living not the reverse.
6. The time to prepare for death is now. [[1 John#^add9a1|1 John 5:13]] – I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.

How can we get “Eternal Life”?

### Grace

1. Eternal life is a free gift.
	[[Romans#^033f8c|Romans 6:23]] – For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ [[Jesus]] our Lord.
2. Eternal life is not earned or deserved.
	[[Ephesians#^28cd35|Ephesians 2:8-9]] – For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast.
	What is the difference between GIFT vs. REWARD.

Are you ready to receive this gift?

### Man

1. There is a problem called sin.
	1. Are we good enough to go to heaven?
		- Did you obey the ten [[Exodus#^54c9f2|commandments]]?
		- Have you ever kill anyone?
			[[1 John#^612365|1 John 3:15]] – Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in Him. 
		- Have you ever committed adultery?
			[[Matthew#^2148e3|Matthew 5:28]] – But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
			[[James#^c0898b|James 2:10]] – For whoever keeps the whole and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
	2. Sin that we are not yet familiar.
		[[James#^044667|James 4:17]] – Anyone, then, who know the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins.
	3. Passing grade.
		[[Matthew#^3f6e5f|Matthew 5:48]] – Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
2. Man cannot save himself.
	Illustration: 3 sins per day ≈ 1,000 sins per year.
	[[Isaiah#^443eea|Isaiah 64:6]] – All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like wind our sins sweep us away.
	[[Ezekiel#^68ae06|Ezekiel 33:13]] – If I tell the righteous man that he will surely live, but then he trusts in his righteousness and does evil, none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered; he will die for the evil he has done.

What does God think about this?

### God

1. Common Misconception
	God is like a grandfather – exaggerate His love and mercy.
	God is like a policeman – exaggerate His wrath and anger.
	God is like a Santa Claus – believing God for just worldly things.
	God is like a scrooge – KJ, wanted Christians to live in miserable and unhappy life, so sacrificial and boring.
	[[John#^2ce159|John 10:10]] – The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
2. God is loving and just.
	Merciful – does not want to punish us.
		[[1 John#^1cc240|1 John 4:8]] – Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
	Just – must punish sins.
		[[Exodus#^10939f|Exodus 34:7]] - …maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished; He punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.

“God solved this problem in the person of [[Jesus]] Christ.”

### [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]

1. Who is He?
	[[Colossians#^a3ad7a|Colossians 1:15]] – He is the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation.
	- Both man and God
	- Visible expression of the invisible God.
2. What He did?
	[[Matthew#^8e83be|Matthew 1:21]] – She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name [[Jesus]], because he will save his people from their sins.
	- Mission - to save us from sin
	- Crucification – greatest expression of God’s love for us.
		- Crowned w/ thorns, rope w/ 39 nails w/ arrows
		- Stubbed w/ spear
	- He did not do it for us to have pity on Him, it’s the other way around.
	- Mission accomplished.
		[[John#^7fd435|John 19:30]] – When he had received the drink, [[Jesus]] said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

“This gift is received by faith.”

### Faith

1. What saving faith is not.
	- Merely an intellectual assent even Satan believes in this fact.
	- “Know about [[Jesus]]” vs. “Knowing [[Jesus]]”
2. Temporary faith
	- Trusting God for temporal things of life such as health, family, and finances.
3. What is saving faith?
	- Trusting in [[Jesus]] Christ alone for salvation, not through good works
	- Complete transfer of faith to [[Jesus]] Christ that what He did in the cross is already enough for our salvation.
